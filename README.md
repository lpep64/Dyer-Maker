# Prompt for an MVP Digital Twin of a Resilient Manufacturing Testbed

### Role and Goal
You are an expert Robotics and AI Engineer. Your task is to act as a project manager and technical lead to design a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a digital twin of a manufacturing testbed. This MVP will serve as the foundational environment for future research on Dynamic Job Shop Scheduling (DJSS), resiliency, and decentralized systems.

### Project Context
The project is to develop a mini factory testbed that simulates Amazon-style warehouse operations. The physical testbed uses Niryo Ned robots and various conveyors. [cite_start]The core problem is to solve complex DJSS problems in real-time, which includes handling dynamic challenges like unpredictable orders and equipment failures[cite: 264, 279, 281]. [cite_start]The final system will include a physical testbed and a digital twin (a high-fidelity simulation) to test scenarios that are too risky or expensive to run on the physical system[cite: 265, 362].

[cite_start]The system architecture is based on ROS2, with individual hardware components (robots, conveyors, sensors) represented as ROS2 nodes[cite: 36, 37, 84, 85, 86]. The project has already completed the initial setup to access the robot's URDF and STL files.

### MVP Scope & Objective
The highest priority for this MVP is to create a functional, modular digital twin environment in ROS2 and Gazebo that acts as an advanced model of the physical testbed.

The specific, first-use case for this MVP is the following:
1.  **Identify Part:** A vision sensor node (`vision_node`) detects a part on a conveyor and publishes its color.
2.  **Pick & Place:** A single Niryo Ned robot (R1) picks up the colored part from one conveyor.
3.  **Transfer:** The robot places the part onto a second conveyor.

### Technical Requirements
The final MVP solution must adhere to the following technical constraints:
* **Simulation Platform:** ROS2 and Gazebo.
* **Modularity:** The solution must be designed as a modular environment. [cite_start]Each component (robots, conveyors, sensors) should be a separate, reusable asset that can be easily rearranged and combined to replicate different factory layouts[cite: 365, 307].
* [cite_start]**Architecture:** The solution must be based on a ROS2 node architecture, as described in the project's documentation[cite: 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57].
* **Assets:** The solution must use the provided Niryo Ned robot URDF and STL files as the foundation for the robot models.

### Deliverables
The final response should be a comprehensive MVP Proposal formatted as a single large markdown file. It must include the following sections:

1.  **Project Summary:** A brief overview of the MVP's purpose and its role in the larger project.
2.  **MVP Scope & Use Case:** A detailed description of the MVP's functionality, including the specific pick-and-place scenario.
3.  **System Architecture Design:** A clear, step-by-step breakdown of the proposed ROS2/Gazebo architecture. This should include:
    * A list of the required ROS2 nodes (`vision_node`, `sensor_node`, `pick_place_node`, etc.) and their specific responsibilities.
    * A description of the ROS2 topics and messages used for communication between nodes (`object_ready`, `object_color`, `pick_place_command`).
4.  **Implementation Plan (Step-by-Step Guide):** A detailed, numbered list of the technical steps required to build the MVP. This should be a guide for a developer to follow, from creating the Gazebo world and URDF/SDF models to writing the ROS2 nodes and the main launch file.
5.  **Future Work:** A section outlining how this MVP can be expanded to achieve the other advanced project goals (e.g., adding more robots, implementing dispatching algorithms, simulating failures, or exploring decentralized control).

### Reasoning Instructions
Let's think step by step to ensure a robust and logical solution. First, define the core components and their interactions in the Gazebo simulation environment. Then, map these to the required ROS2 nodes and topics. Finally, lay out a clear, sequential plan for implementation, starting with the simplest elements and building up to the complete MVP.

# Gazebo Logistic Testbed

## Step 1

Follow the first 4 steps from the following github repo: `https://github.com/NiryoRobotics/ned-ros2-driver` to create the ros2_driver_ws. Upon completion of this step you should be able to access the URDF and STL files of the robots.

## Software:

The testbed has Ubuntu 24.04, ROS2 Jazzy and Gazebo 8.9.0. Gazebo 8.9 is old version and is no longer supported by the gazebo community. So you donâ€™t have to use this. You can go for the latest version. 

## Snapshot of the 4 steps that you are required to do from the above git repository.

Once you have complete the 4 steps, you should be able to navigate to the following folder and see if the files are present.

As you can see the mesh and urdf folders are inside the directory ~/ros2_drivers_ws/src/ned-ros2-driver/niryo_ned_description$

```bash
(venv) labfab@labfab-Alienware-Area-51-R5:~/ros2_drivers_ws/src/ned-ros2-driver/niryo_ned_description$ ls
CMakeLists.txt  launch  meshes  package.xml  rviz  urdf
```

All the urdf files are xacro. Inside my code I convert them into urdf. So no need to worry about the conversion

```bash
(venv) labfab@labfab-Alienware-Area-51-R5:~/ros2_drivers_ws/src/ned-ros2-driver/niryo_ned_description/urdf/ned2$ ls
niryo_ned2_camera.urdf.xacro  niryo_ned2_gripper1_n_camera.urdf.xacro  niryo_ned2_param.urdf.xacro  niryo_ned2.urdf.xacro  without_mesh_niryo_ned2.urdf.xacro
```

This will give you access to all the stl files.

```bash
venv) labfab@labfab-Alienware-Area-51-R5:~/ros2_drivers_ws/src/ned-ros2-driver/niryo_ned_description/meshes/ned2/stl$ ls
arm_link.stl  base_link.stl  elbow_link.stl  forearm_link.stl  hand_link.stl  shoulder_link.stl  wrist_link.stl
```

## Step 2

Make sure to add the following lines to your bash script.

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc

# Add the below files at the bottom of the bash script
source ~/ros2_drivers_ws/venv/bin/activate
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
source ~/ros2_drivers_ws/install/setup.bash
 
# Close and open the terminal

```

## Step 3

Add the below line to the environment. This is required to let the gazebo know the directory for the files

```bash
export GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH=/home/labfab/ros2_drivers_ws/install/niryo_ned_description/share:$GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH
```

## Step 4

Run the following script 

```bash
ros2 launch niryo_gazebo_multi_launch.py # multiple robot spawn
ros2 launch niryo_gazebo_single_launch.py #single robot spawn
```
