# MVP Digital Twin Proposal for Resilient Manufacturing Testbed

## Project Summary

This MVP proposal outlines the development of a foundational digital twin environment for a resilient manufacturing testbed using ROS2 and Gazebo. The digital twin serves as a high-fidelity simulation platform that mirrors the physical testbed operations, enabling safe testing of complex Dynamic Job Shop Scheduling (DJSS) algorithms, resiliency scenarios, and decentralized control systems.

The physical testbed simulates Amazon-style warehouse operations using Niryo Ned robots and conveyor systems.

**Key Value Proposition:**
- **Risk Mitigation:** Test dangerous or expensive scenarios without physical hardware risk
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Iterate on algorithms and control strategies faster than physical testing allows
- **Scalability:** Easily reconfigure factory layouts and test multiple scenarios
- **Research Foundation:** Provide solid groundwork for advanced DJSS and resiliency research

## MVP Scope & Use Case

### Primary Use Case: Single Robot Pick-and-Place with Vision Detection

The MVP focuses on implementing a complete, functional pick-and-place workflow that demonstrates the core capabilities required for more complex manufacturing operations.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. **Part Detection Phase:**
   - A vision sensor node (`vision_node`) continuously monitors Conveyor 1
   - When a colored part (red, green, or blue) enters the detection zone, the vision system identifies its color
   - The color information is published to the ROS2 topic system with confidence percentages
   
2. **Communication Phase:**
   - Vision data is processed and validated by a sensor coordination node
   - Pick-and-place commands are generated and sent to the robot controller
   - Status updates are broadcast to all relevant system components

3. **Robotic Manipulation Phase:**
   - Niryo Ned Robot (R1) receives pick command with part location and color data
   - Robot moves to precise pickup position above the part on Conveyor 1
   - Gripper engages and securely grasps the colored part
   - Robot executes transfer trajectory to Conveyor 2
   - Part is placed at designated location on Conveyor 2
   - Robot returns to home position and signals completion

**Success Criteria:**
- 95% successful part detection accuracy for target colors
- <5 second total cycle time from detection to placement
- Zero collisions during robotic operations
- Reliable communication between all system nodes
- Proper error handling and recovery procedures

### Supported Configurations

**Part Types:**
- Red colored parts (target confidence >80%)
- Green colored parts (target confidence >80%) 
- Blue colored parts (target confidence >80%)
- Mixed part sequences for complex testing scenarios

**Conveyor Configurations:**
- Standard linear conveyor setup (Conveyor 1 → Robot → Conveyor 2)
- Adjustable conveyor speeds (0.1 - 1.0 m/s)
- Configurable part spacing and timing

**Robot Configurations:**
- Single Niryo Ned2 robot with standard gripper
- Customizable pickup and placement positions
